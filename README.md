# Notes 01: Cloud Concept Overview 
‚òÅÔ∏è üíª

### *1.1 What is Information Technology (IT)?*
To get an idea of IT you need to expand your horizon.
This class is about IT related to cloud computing.

    "Cloud computing is a subset of IT, it utilizes the same terminology."

### *1.2 Why is IT important?*
Most businesses rely on computers, and in the networks that connect them, and they need to keep maintaining a standard of service, security and connectivity in order to keep functioning.  IT provides smart solutions and helps companies to outsmart and out deliver competitors. 

It specialist work on :


**Data Overload**  Requires power, software and human analytical skills

**Mobile and Wireless Usages** That can be used with smartphones, tables and laptops

**Cloud Services** Third party hosting platforms that maintain the data

**Bandwidth for Video** For videoconferences.

### 1.3 Hardware vs Software
*Hardware* is all the physical components of IT. Ex computer, motherboard, Central processing unit (CPU), RAM, and hard drives, Keyboard, mouse, printer.
*Software* cannot be touched. It is all the data, application code, programs stored digitally, and it is stored on a hardware device.
In Cloud computing the hardware and software use the same terminology as the physical. Virtual hardware has CPU, RAM and Hard Drives, but runs as software on top of specialized hardware

### *1.4 Four Pillars of an IT Framework*
#### Infrastructure
Set of IT components that are the foundation of an IT service. Physical components (computers, networking hardware and facilities) and other software and network components. Responsible for assembling the components and supporting daily tech needs through help desk and software support.
#### Development.(builds software. Process of writing and maintaining source code. It includes
Conceptualizing software
Defining requirements
Designing how it will work
#### Programing
Documenting its functionality
Testing against the requirements
Bug fixing any issues
	
#### Security
Strategies that prevent unauthorized access to organizational assets. Maintains integrity and confidentiality. (Hardware and Software)
Data
Can be stored and used as information. IT manages, and analyze information to offer business insights and determines how to best allow flexibility while maintaining overall corporate guidance (Hardware and Software)

### 1.6 Terminology: Jobs Roles & Occupation
"Employment of IT professionals is projected to grow 12 from 2018 to 2028 (546,200 new jobs). Media annual is $88.240".
Each role has a specialization on analysis, scientists, architects, programmers and administrators.

### 1.7 Terminology: Computer Components
As IT Professionals all parts are important, and for Cloud Computing, it is important to know specifically the components of the CPU, RAM, Storage and Expansion cards.

##### Basic hardware components
**Motherboard**

Is the main circuit board of a computer. The CPU, RAM and expansion cards attach to the motherboard. 
It has input and output ports available to plug divides to interact with the computer ( like audio, monitor, usb, networking).

**Central Processing Unit (CPU)**

In Cloud Computing. It's important to understand it when configuring a computer or server in the cloud, same on the physical.
Primary component, processes instructions. Runs the operating system and applications. Contains at least one processor

**Random Access Memory (RAM)**
In  Computing, it works when configuring a computer or server in the cloud. Is made of small memory chips that form a memory module and they are the same in cloud computing. RAM improves the speed.

**Storage Drives**
In Cloud Computing it is important to know how Storage works. It is necessary to select the correct type of storage before starting to transfer the data, and as well in physical computing equipment. 
There are two types of storage, one is the Primary storage which holds files for the operating system and critical applications and the Secondary storage which can be removable, internal or external and is used to hold files or applications depending on the setup.

**Hard Disk Drive (HDD)**
Non-volatile memory hardware that permanently stores and retrieves data on a computer. It is a secondary storage device and consists of one or more platters where data is written using a magnetic head. Internal HDD connects to the motherboard. All computers have a HDD.

**Solid State Drive (SSD)**
Storage medium that uses non-volatile memory. Can be a replacement for standard hard drive in computers and laptops. Also a solution for notebooks, nettops, and other applications that do not need a lot of storage.

**Expansion Cards**
A printed circuit board that can be inserted to an expansion slot of a computer motherboard to add additional functionality to a computer system via the expansion bus, like audio cards, graphic cards, network cards, TV tuners, USB cards, Video capture.

**Graphic Cards (GPU)**
Is an electronic circuit used to speed up the creation of 2D and 3D images, can be integrated or can be dedicated. Used for video games and are part of high performance computing in order to accelerate machine-learning or increase speed for advance modeling of scientific calculations when used in cloud.

**Audio Cards**
**Networking Components**
**Cooling**
**Power Supply**
**Case**
**Input & Output Devices**
**Peripherals**

**ARM Processor**
32 bit RISC processor, microprocessor in mobiles, also used in PDA (person digital assistants).
32-bit and 64-bit Architecture Processors
Found in Laptops, workstations or servers. CPU is the amount of architecture of the info that the CPU can process each time of operation. Difference between 32 and 64  is the number of calculations per second and the amount of memory 

**Input/Output Devices**. Allow users to enter data into a system or control operation, ex mouse, keyboard.
